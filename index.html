                            Ivan, a Ukrainian farmer engaged in sowing various crops. From year to year, he diligently cultivated the land on his plots, but this year everything changed. Mined fields have become a terrible reality of the Ukrainian people.After the outbreak of military conflict, Russian soldiers invaded Ukrainian territory and mined many fields, including those belonging to Ivan. Mine after mine was sown into his native lands, turning them into dangerous and deadly zones.This situation presented Ivan with a difficult choice: give up his plot of land and lose everything he has built over the years, or find a way to return his fields. Many lands temporarily occupied by Russian troops are currently unsuitable for sowing. And although the danger of mined fields stopped many, Ivan decided not to give up and take matters into his own hands - to independently look for organizations that can help in mine clearance.Otherwise, he will lose the work of his whole life and the life of his family.

                            Anton is a farmer who lived in a small village in Kherson Oblast. Unlike most villagers, he did not grow crops but preferred working with animals. He led his own livestock farm: cows, and pigs.Anton was always the one who sought the high-quality products that his farm offered to others.However, due to the full-scale invasion of Russian troops to the territory of Ukraine, Anton's farm was on the line of hostilities, and soon completely under occupation.Fortunately, the animals had time to evacuate and resettle in different farmlands of the region. After the liberation of the right bank of Kherson Oblast, Anton decided to return to his native land and revive his brainchild. But, during the occupation and active hostilities, the farm was damaged, in addition, there is a possibility that the territory where cows often grazed was mined by the invaders.In order to continue the existence of Anton's farm and focus on restoring and returning his herd, it is necessary to check and clear the entire territory. It is impossible to do this on our own, and because there are so many similar sites across Ukraine, alternative solutions to the situation are simply unavoidable.

                            Dmytro is a farmer from Ukraine, and his whole family used to grow grain and corn. Every spring, he used to start preparing for the sowing season as scheduled, but for the second year in a row, he has been unable to do his business because his field is still waiting for demining.Dmytro already turned to the authorities and asked for help in demining, but the process turned out to be long and difficult. Unfortunately, the state cannot immediately solve this problem due to limited resources, because there are too many such mined areas in the areas where hostilities are or have been.In order for Dmytro's fields to be useful in the near future, alternative solutions for demining the fields are needed. Otherwise, Dmytro will be able to return to his business in at least 5 years.

                        <div class="stories-item-text">
                            Farmer Pavlo was a passionate farmer and raised cattle on his farm. He lived in the peaceful countryside of Ukraine, but after the arrival of Russian troops in the region, mines and shells were left in his pastures, which became a huge problem for Pavlo and his animals.Pavlo is deeply concerned about the safety of his herd. The field where his animals were grazing was mined, posing a constant threat to their lives. He cannot simply move his animals to another place, as pastures are his only resource for feeding his cattle.He turned to the local authorities, hoping for help in clearing his fields of mines, but realised that the process could take a long time. Moreover, the priority now is to liberate settlements, roads and infrastructure. The SES does not have enough staff and resources to clear all the land in a short time.Today, Pavlo is looking for different ways to demine the pasture himself to secure his farm.

                                Ivan, a Ukrainian farmer engaged in sowing various crops. From year to year, he diligently cultivated the land on his plots, but this year everything changed. Mined fields have become a terrible reality of the Ukrainian people.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                After the outbreak of military conflict, Russian soldiers invaded Ukrainian territory and mined many fields, including those belonging to Ivan. Mine after mine was sown into his native lands, turning them into dangerous and deadly zones.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                This situation presented Ivan with a difficult choice: give up his plot of land and lose everything he has built over the years, or find a way to return his fields. Many lands temporarily occupied by Russian troops are currently unsuitable for sowing. And although the danger of mined fields stopped many, Ivan decided not to give up and take matters into his own hands - to independently look for organizations that can help in mine clearance.Otherwise, he will lose the work of his whole life and the life of his family.

                                Anton is a farmer who lived in a small village in Kherson Oblast. Unlike most villagers, he did not grow crops but preferred working with animals. He led his own livestock farm: cows, and pigs.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Anton was always the one who sought the high-quality products that his farm offered to others.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                However, due to the full-scale invasion of Russian troops to the territory of Ukraine, Anton's farm was on the line of hostilities, and soon completely under occupation.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Fortunately, the animals had time to evacuate and resettle in different farmlands of the region. After the liberation of the right bank of Kherson Oblast, Anton decided to return to his native land and revive his brainchild. But, during the occupation and active hostilities, the farm was damaged, in addition, there is a possibility that the territory where cows often grazed was mined by the invaders.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                In order to continue the existence of Anton's farm and focus on restoring and returning his herd, it is necessary to check and clear the entire territory. It is impossible to do this on our own, and because there are so many similar sites across Ukraine, alternative solutions to the situation are simply unavoidable.

                                Dmytro is a farmer from Ukraine, and his whole family used to grow grain and corn. Every spring, he used to start preparing for the sowing season as scheduled, but for the second year in a row, he has been unable to do his business because his field is still waiting for demining.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Dmytro already turned to the authorities and asked for help in demining, but the process turned out to be long and difficult. Unfortunately, the state cannot immediately solve this problem due to limited resources, because there are too many such mined areas in the areas where hostilities are or have been.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                In order for Dmytro's fields to be useful in the near future, alternative solutions for demining the fields are needed. Otherwise, Dmytro will be able to return to his business in at least 5 years.

                                Farmer Pavlo was a passionate farmer and raised cattle on his farm. He lived in the peaceful countryside of Ukraine, but after the arrival of Russian troops in the region, mines and shells were left in his pastures, which became a huge problem for Pavlo and his animals.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Pavlo is deeply concerned about the safety of his herd. The field where his animals were grazing was mined, posing a constant threat to their lives. He cannot simply move his animals to another place, as pastures are his only resource for feeding his cattle.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                He turned to the local authorities, hoping for help in clearing his fields of mines, but realised that the process could take a long time. Moreover, the priority now is to liberate settlements, roads and infrastructure. The SES does not have enough staff and resources to clear all the land in a short time.

                                <br>
                                Today, Pavlo is looking for different ways to demine the pasture himself to secure his farm.
